Yesterday I attended the [_Global Day of Code Retreat, 2011_](http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-coderetreat-2011) in Sydney. We were incredibly
privileged to have the creator of Code Retreat, [Corey Haines](http://twitter.com/coreyhaines) himself
facilitating.

I found the experience to be really very profound and recommend it without reserve to developers of all levels.

Here are some of the things I took from the day:

- My C++/RUP based thinking of OO really needs a makeover
- I thought I was practising Test Driven Development (TDD) but I now see how narrow my understanding of TDD was.
The _evil coder_ or _Mute with Find the Loophole_ session of the retreat was simultaneously hilarious, frustrating and enlightening on how well tests actually serve as a specification for code
- The principles of _Simple Design_ (attributed to the best of my knowledge to Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries in the Extreme Programming book)

I've come across each of the 4 principles of simple design but when I heard Corey talk through them in sequence, it really made a difference
to the way I understand them.  I know that this understanding will change as I practice with them and I will not remember them as well when I get to work on Monday,
so I'm writing them down here so I can remind myself of them:

1. Runs all the tests
1. Expresses every idea that we need to express
1. Says everything once and only once
1. Has no superfluous parts

I look forward to practicing the principles I learned at code retreat.  I have no doubt that I have had a step change in my perspective as a programmer - more power to
Corey's efforts at [coderetreat.org](http://coderetreat.org) I say!
