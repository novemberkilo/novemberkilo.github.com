        <p>Polar coordinates and polar functions are remarkably beautiful to people who get mathematics.
          I think that their <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar+curves">graphs</a> are beautiful to most people. Ever since I first met them,
          I&#39;ve tried to draw them on different platforms and using different languages. Wanting to know more about canvas and javascript,
          I thought that it would be interesting to implement a polar curve grapher using these.</p>
        
        <p>A quick reminder - the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar+coordinates">polar coordinates</a> <code>( r, t )</code> of a point
          are expressed in terms of the distance <code>r</code> of the point from the origin and the angle <code>t</code>
          that the line connecting the point to the origin makes with the <code>x</code>-axis. Also, the way you get from a set of polar coordinates <code>(r, t)</code>
          to cartesian coordinates <code>(x, y)</code> is:</p>
        
        <pre><code>    x = r * cos(t), y = r * sin(t)&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <h4>Background</h4>
        
        <p>Earlier on this year I had asked <a href="http://avantbard.com">Gabe Hollombe</a> for advice on things I could do to become a better programmer.
          Around the time of the conversation, I was particularly aware of my lack of knowledge of
          javascript and so, we chose my polar-curve-grapher as a project for Gabe to mentor me through.</p>
        
        <p>I started off by checking out the landscape of javascript based graphing tools and apps and came across the
          following:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Kevin Mehall&#39;s <a href="http://kevinmehall.net/p/equationexplorer">EquationExplorer</a></li>
        <li>aanthony&#39;s <a href="http://graph.tk">graph.tk</a></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Given my relative lack of experience with javascript, I found both apps difficult to understand.
          So, I tried to figure out how to do it by myself.  I looked for javascript libraries I could use to simply plot a bunch of points
          and found a lot of stuff for charts but relatively few that would just take an array of
          points and plot them. Here are some that fit the bill:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li><a href="http://www.jqplot.com/">jQplot</a></li>
        <li>Keith Lawler&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/lawler/raphael.graphing">raphael.graphing.js</a></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>I played around with jqplot and a hard-coded function <code>r = f(t)</code> to get some quick results.  Essentially, I
          created an array of points to be plotted using the following direct approach:</p>
        
        <pre><code>    points_to_be_plotted = []&#x000A;    for t in (0 ... 6*PI)&#x000A;    points_to_be_plotted.push [ f(t)*cos(t), f(t)*sin(t) ]&#x000A;&#x000A;    jqPlot( point_to_be_plotted )&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>And this is what jQplot did for me:</p>
        
        <!--<img src='/images/Polar_function_grapher-jqplot.jpg' style='border: solid; border-color: gray; border-width: 2px' />-->
        
        <p><img src='/images/Polar_function_grapher-jqplot.jpg' class='img-rounded img-center' /></p>
        
        <p>This gave me a quick proof of concept and, the project had a life! I now needed to figure out how to get user input, process it, and then plot it.</p>
        
        <h4>Parsing user input</h4>
        
        <p>Getting user input turned out to be straightforward - use a form in the page with a submit button and respond
          to the button click by picking up the input in javascript as a string (say) <code>&quot;input_fn&quot;</code>.  Use <code>eval(&quot;input_fn(t)&quot;)</code> to turn this into a javascript
          function and follow the psuedocode above to generate an array of points to be plotted (see the source of the project for the detail - more on this below).</p>
        
        <p>But what if you want the user to enter a function in
          plain, pedestrian maths (instead of the syntax required by javascript) - e.g. <code>2sin(x)</code> instead of <code>2 * Math.sin(x)</code></p>
        
        <p>Kevin&#39;s EquationExplorer did this so I set out to understand how.
          And this lead me to the world of Top-Down-Operator-Precedence (TDOP) parsers.</p>
        
        <p>I will write more about TDOP parsers in my next post but to complete the story on the polar curve grapher, these were the
          ingredients that went into the grapher that <a href="http://github.com/novemberkilo/polar-curve-grapher">you can find here.</a></p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Parsing: Kevin Mehall&#39;s <code>tdop_math.js</code> parser (that requires <code>tokens.js,</code> a lexer written by Douglas Crockford himself)</li>
        <li>Graphing: Keith Lawler&#39;s graphing library that is based on <code>raphael.js</code> and called, <a href="https://github.com/lawler/raphael.graphing">raphael.graphing.js</a></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>And thanks to GitHub pages, you can see it in action here: <a href="http://novemberkilo.com/polar-curve-grapher">http://novemberkilo.com/polar-curve-grapher</a></p>
        
        <p>At the time of posting this I still needed to apply a coat or two of polish - I&#39;m not doing any graceful error handling (so try not to divide by zero!) and I&#39;m
          only winding around the origin three times. You should be able to play around though and get some pretty graphs.</p>
        
        <p>Try <code>r = sin(3t)</code> to get started with a propeller :)</p>
        
        <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
        
        <p>I had a lot of fun putting this project together and owe a debt of gratitude to <a href="http://avantbard.com">Gabe Hollombe</a> for encouraging me to take this on, and for answering questions
          and providing guidance along the way.  Also, thanks to Keith Lawler and Kevin Mehall for doing the heavy lifting - this project turned out to mainly involve
          stitching together their libraries.</p>
