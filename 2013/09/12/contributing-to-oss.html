<h2>Contributing to Discourse</h2>
<h4>Therapeutic Refactoring</h4>
<div class='pull-right'>
<time>Sep 12 2013</time>

<br>
<p><em>Junior/Intermediate Ruby developers looking for an Open Source project to contribute to 
should consider practising clean coding techniques by refactoring the Discourse project.</em></p>

<p>Until around July this year, I had not contributed any code to an open source project. I have just ticked over three years as a professional
developer and I have had the mandatory <em>contribute to OSS</em> on a to-do list for a while now. Until July this year I had submitted pull requests to 
a couple of projects that added to their documentation - I wanted to contribute code but despite the many posts out there on 
how-to-get-started-contributing-to-oss, I didn’t have much success! </p>

<p>Then a couple of things happened:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I realised that I too find refactoring to be therapeutic</li>
  <li>I met Discourse</li>
</ul>

<p>To elaborate, Katrina Owen’s (<a href="http://twitter.com/kytrinyx">@kytrinyx</a>) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4dlF0kcThQ">talk on Therapeutic Refactoring</a> had a profound impact on me.
A couple of days after watching it, I found in a state of almost
post-meditative calm, staring at a pull request that cleaned up some complicated and unhappy code that I had written at work a few years ago. Code Climate 
showed me some nice shades of green, and I realised that I also find refactoring to be therapeutic! </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse">Discourse</a> is an Ember and Rails project and so uses the technologies that I had spent a lot of time with at work. 
Its core team includes Jeff Atwood (<a href="http://twitter.com/codinghorror">@codinghorror</a>), Robin Ward (<a href="http://twitter.com/eviltrout">@eviltrout</a>) and Sam Saffron(<a href="http://twitter.com/samsaffron">@samsaffron</a>) of Stack Overflow fame, 
and its <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2013/02/civilized-discourse-construction-kit.html">pitch</a> is pretty far reaching! </p>

<p>I had met Sam Saffron at a Ruby meetup in Sydney and was inspired by his talk on his <a href="http://miniprofiler.com/">MiniProfiler</a> project so when I first heard about (his involvement with) Discourse, 
I poked around a bit and ended up on <a href="http://meta.discourse.org">meta.discourse.org</a> - before long I
found their post on <a href="http://meta.discourse.org/t/so-you-want-to-help-out-with-discourse/3823">how to contribute to Discourse.</a> </p>

<p>I figured maybe I’d use Discourse as an opportunity to practise refactoring and reinforce the coding principles I had been reading about in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sandi-Metz/e/B0097WWH62">Sandi Metz’s book</a>,
and on the <a href="http://blog.codeclimate.com/">Code Climate blog</a>, and submitted <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/881">my first pull request.</a> </p>

<p>Wondering how I knew where to start? By looking at the <a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/discourse/discourse">Code Climate report of Discourse</a> and picking a smell. Setting up the project 
for development wasn’t so hard thanks to <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/docs/DEVELOPER-ADVANCED.md">excellent documentation.</a> I used <a href="http://sadi.st/Ruby_Sadist.html">flog and flay</a> 
locally to monitor the progress of my efforts until I discovered later that you can register your fork of Discourse with Code Climate. Once you have forked the project, 
try hitting <em>http://codeclimate.com/github/your-github-handle/discourse</em> and Code Climate will help you through the rest. </p>

<p>I found Sam and Robin’s feedback to be excellent and encouraging and was reminded how important it is to find a project that is maintained by folks who communicate well!</p>

<p>By the end of the summer (I’m in the northern hemisphere at the moment), I had made several contributions to Discourse, learning a ton along the way. I even implemented a feature and 
helped a bit on their Rails4 upgrade. One of my <a href="https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/1185#issuecomment-20971446">better refactoring pull requests</a> was used in an interview to demonstrate my journey towards writing better code (I got the job!). </p>

<p>If you are in a similar stage in your journey as a developer, I encourage you to spend some time (therapeutically) refactoring your open source project of choice. As you can see, Discourse is a good candidate! Also, a word of advice - stay with the 
principle of having fun and playing to your strengths. I found contributing to the Rails side of Discourse to have a much better yield than the Ember side. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
